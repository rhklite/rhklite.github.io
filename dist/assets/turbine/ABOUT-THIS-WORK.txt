Title: Design of Variable Guide Vane Mechanism for Pico-Scale Fracis Hydro Turbine

Description:
Project DescriptionThis is a 3.5 month thesis under University of Toronto Water and Energy Research Lab (WERL) from January 2018 to April 2018. It is in collaboration with a Toronto based company as part of a larger effort to develop an energy harvester for a self-powered, inline water disinfection system for pico-scale applications to provide safe drinking water and electricity to remote communities.

This thesis presents a novel
design of a variable guide vane mechanism as a pressure control mechanism for a pico-scale hydro Francis
turbine. The proposed design can replace
the conventional pressure control valve by regulating pressure with a set of
variable guide vanes and and harness the energy from the hydraulic head that is
otherwise lost with a conventional pressure control valve. The guide vanes
(sometimes referred to as wicket gates) are used for flow regulation
over incoming or outgoing fluids by reducing the flow cross sectional area and
changing the turbine runnerâ€™s angle of attack. This design uses a
guide ring to synchronously rotate the guide vanes through a set of levers and
pivot pins. A stepper motor with a high reduction ratio gear box is employed as the guide vane actuator.
