Title: Droplet Impingement Research

Description:
Project DescriptionThis is a summer research project conducted at University of Toronto Multi-phase Flow and Spray Systems Lab from May 2015 to September 2015.
Droplet dynamics are studied extensively in the field of
fluid dynamics for its applications in spray and atomization, aircraft engine
propulsion, and fuel jet injection. This research is to gain an understanding of
the breakup dynamics of a droplet under impingement of an air jet, and attempt
to discover a new method of atomization for spray technologies. Such is done
via a parametric study with the following parameters; air velocity, jet
diameter, droplet diameter, impact location and droplet viscosity. Main focus of this research is effect of varying air velocity and
jet diameter. Open image in new window and zoom in for detailed view.

Contribution:
Defined detailed research scope and
conducted research on droplet breakup phenomena under minimum supervision

Developed DSLR, PC and fluid piping
synchronization system using Arduino to automate experimental data collection
process resulting in reduction of over 85% of data collection time 

Gathered near 4000 image data, and performed in
depth qualitative and quantitative analysis of the datum using fluid mechanics
theory, Minitab, ImageJ and Imagemagick

Discovered and classified 13 droplet breakup phenomena
