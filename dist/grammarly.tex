This project was a collaboration with a Toronto-based start-up company as a part of a larger effort to develop an energy harvester for a self-powered, inline water disinfection system to provide safe drinking water and electricity to remote communities.

I developed a design of a variable guide vane mechanism for a palm-sized hydro Francis turbine. It can replace the conventional pressure control valve by regulating the pressure with a set of variable guide vanes and harness the energy from the hydraulic head that is overwise lost with a conventional pressure control valve. 

The guide vanes regulate the fluid flow by reducing the flow's cross-sectional area and changing its angle of attack to the turbine blades. The guide vanes are actuated via a set of levers and pivot pints connected to a guide ring. A stepper motor with a high reduction ratio gearbox is controlled by an Arduino to rotate the guide ring. This design was tested in a pressurized pipe flow rig to demonstrate its feasibility.
